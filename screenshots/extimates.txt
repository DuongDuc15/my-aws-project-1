Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage1
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage


1. In a multi-AZ setup, failover to another AZ occurs automatically and may take a few minutes to complete.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage:
- 00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes) 
- 00:05 - An alert triggers (5 minutes) 
- 00:15 - On-call staff realize the situation, get to computer, log in (10 minutes) 
- 00:35 - Diagnosing issue (20 minutes) 
- 00:45 - Discover root cause (10 minutes) 
- 00:55 - Remediation (10 minutes)
- 01:00 - Remediation completed (5 minutes) 
       Total time: 60 minutes 

3. Since failover to another AZ takes only a few minutes, a small amount of data may be lost during the process.       
    
4. When an RDS database is configured with automatic backups enabled, the RPO depends on the backup frequency. For instance, if backups are scheduled every 2 hours, the minimum RPO will be 2 hours.
